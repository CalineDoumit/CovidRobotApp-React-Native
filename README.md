# React-Native

## Creating your blank react-native app

You can create your react native app by following the instructions given [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

```[bash]
yarn global add expo-cli
expo init conFusion
```

Choose the "blank" option

```[bash]
cd conFusion
yarn start
```

Or to run directly in your web browser:

```[bash]
cd conFusion
yarn web
```

[Here is an Expo guide](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/already-used-react-native/) to take a look at after you've learned react Native.
